Developed a collaborative and content-based recommender system designed to predict user ratings for anime titles they have not yet viewed, leveraging their historical preferences.
Developed a robust anime recommender system capable of accurately predicting user preferences based on viewing history, ratings, and preferences, with performance validated using RMSE. Designed the Fusion-X Network app using Streamlit, featuring an engaging and user-friendly interface for seamless exploration of recommendations. Engineered the system for scalability, ensuring efficient handling of large data volumes and optimal performance during peak usage. Carefully selected and optimized the best-fit model from multiple algorithms to meet project requirements, showcasing expertise in machine learning, user experience design, and system scalability.

**üõ†Ô∏è Tech Environment**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, NLTK, opinion_lexicon, WordCloud ü§ñ Machine Learning: SVD ‚ú® Highlights: Secured 11th place in the Kaggle anime recommender system competition after successfully submitting a prediction, highlighting our proficiency in recommendation models..

Worked with a team to analyze and predict CO2 emissions in the agri-food sector. Using data from the FAO and IPCC, we aimed to uncover trends and factors contributing to carbon emissions from agriculture and food production. The project focused on developing predictive models and sustainable strategies to help policymakers and agricultural businesses reduce emissions and address climate change.
